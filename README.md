# Enhancing-Animal-Adoption using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This repository contains the code for a deep learning model built to predict the Pawpularity score of pet images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## About

In this project, we aim to predict the Pawpularity score of pet images based on their visual features. We use a CNN architecture to learn the patterns and features present in the images and make predictions.

## Key Features

- Utilizes TensorFlow for deep learning implementation.
- Includes data preprocessing, model training, and prediction scripts.
- Achieved competitive performance with MAE of 0.155 and RMSE of 0.204 on the test dataset.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and follow the installation and usage instructions provided in this [README].

### Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.10)
